# Open Market

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.4.

## Getting started

We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it.

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opendao-protocols/omm-ui.git
cd omm-ui
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm ci
npm start
```

`npm ci` is used instead is `npm install` to replicate exact project dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
